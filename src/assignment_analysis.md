# Assignment description
 
 **Introduction:**
   The assignment is a crucial part of the "Process and Safety" course within the minor Industrial Automation. It involves implementing a solution for valve assembly. The task includes analyzing, documenting, and implementing an assembly process, requiring the construction of an assembly jig, PLC programming, and communication with an ABB robot. The application of knowledge on electrical components, drawings, risk assessment, safety, and process definition is essential.

 **requirements** 
 
1. **Valve Assembly Process:**
   - The system should be capable of assembling a valve used in central heating systems or gas lines from its individual parts to a complete product.
   - The assembly process should involve the precise arrangement and connection of mechanical and electrical components.

2. **Hardware and Software Integration:**
   - The solution will be programmed on a PC capable of running TwinCAT 3 software for the Beckhoff EtherCAT bus.
   - Utilize Digital/Analog/IOLink module(s) provided by Saxion for interfacing with various components during the assembly process.

3. **PLC Programming:**
   - Develop PLC programming logic to control the sequence of the assembly process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
   - The PLC program should include error handling mechanisms to address unforeseen issues during the assembly.

4. **Communication with ABB Industrial Robot:**
   - Implement communication protocols between the PLC system and the ABB industrial robot table to facilitate seamless collaboration.
   - The system should be capable of sending and receiving signals to and from the robot to coordinate tasks.

5. **Removable Base and Manual Operation:**
   - Design the assembly setup on a removable base to allow for easy maintenance and reconfiguration.
   - Include a fixed jig/cassette on the base to enable manual loading of new parts and unloading of the assembled product while in operation.

6. **Interface Design:**
   - Design mechanical parts to ensure proper interfacing between individual parts, the assembly jig, and the robot's gripper for efficient assembly and handling.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation, including electrical drawings, risk assessments, safety protocols, and assembly process details.
   - The documentation should follow the guidelines specified in the rubric provided in the course description.

8. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Implement a testing phase to validate the functionality of the assembly process, including checks for accuracy, reliability, and safety.
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the system meets specified performance criteria and can handle variations in input parameters.
